Welcome to fino2py's documentation!
===================================


Welcome to the documentation for the fino2py Python package!

The `fino2py` package, developed at the Department of Psychology, University of Limerick, aims to provide researchers with a powerful tool for working with raw data generated by the Finapress finometer.

Introduction:
---------------
The Finapress finometer is a widely used device for measuring cardiovascular/hemodynamic data. However, working with the raw data files produced by the finometer can be challenging, requiring a lot of tedious and error-prone copying and pasting.
The `fino2py` package simplifies this process by offering a set of functions and utilities that enable researchers to efficiently ingest, reshape, and and prepare the data for analysis.

Key Features:
---------------
- Data Ingestion: With `fino2py`, researchers can easily import raw `.txt` files generated by the Finapress finometer. The package streamlines the data loading process, allowing for quick access to the collected data.

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: `fino2py` provides simple yet powerful functions for cleaning and preprocessing the raw data. Researchers can apply data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, outliers, or other data quality issues, ensuring the data is suitable for further analysis.

- Timestamp Normalization: Studies involving the Finapress finometer often generate various types of timestamps. `fino2py` includes functions to handle the normalization of these timestamps, making it easier to synchronize and compare data across participants, protocol periods (e.g. baseline, task, recovery) and experimental conditions.

- Integration with pandas: `fino2py` extends the functionality of the popular pandas library, allowing users to efficiently organize and manipulate participant data files. Researchers can easily concatenate data from multiple participants into a single pandas DataFrame, facilitating comprehensive analysis.

- Data Visualization and Inspection: Researchers can save intermediate dataframes to CSV format at different stages of the data processing pipeline. This functionality enables visual inspection and quality assurance, ensuring the consistency and integrity of the data.

The current release (version 0.1.0) of the `fino2py` package provides a starting point for researchers working with Finapress finometer data. The package will continue to evolve, with additional features and improvements planned for future releases.

Whether you are new to programming or an experienced researcher, this documentation will guide you through the installation process, demonstrate the package's functionalities, and provide examples to help you effectively analyze your Finapress finometer data.

We value your feedback! If you have any questions, suggestions, or encounter any issues while using `fino2py`, please don't hesitate to reach out.
