# Welcome

Welcome to the official documentation for Fino2py, a Python package designed to automate the ingestion and reshaping of data produced by the Finapres Finometer. This documentation serves as a guide to help you get started with Fino2py and hopefully help you set up your study for success. 

Whether you're a researcher, clinician, or developer, this documentation will help you use this package to make working with finometer data much faster and easier. I've tried to write this documentation to help those new to python and those who are more experienced. 

This is my first time writing documentation so stick with me here...

## Instal



Each function has `docstrings` that explain what it does so you can alwasy call `help(name_of_function)` to see them if you're not sure of something, but I'm also trying to write fuller examples in this documentation. 

Each function has it's own page which you can access from the list below. 

Please see the [About](about.md) for more context and citation information (please don't foget to cite the package if it is helpful to your research)
