# What I think should be first
- A more in depth expalnaton of the data that is produced by the Finapress finometer. For example a short sentance on what hemodynamics are.
- Would it be possible to include an example of what a data set from the finometer looks like or include a short piece on what form the raw data is in.
- Include that the finometer is also used to record particpants demographic information and that this information is included in the raw data set
- Include a piece on what the data produced from the finometer can be used for and what areas of research it is commonly used for.
