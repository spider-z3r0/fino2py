# About this package

Fino2py is a Python package designed to automate the ingestion and reshaping of data produced by the Finapres Finometer, a device used to measure continuous blood pressure and related cardiovascular variables. The package provides functions to read in raw Finometer data from .txt files, extract chunks of data based on experimental protocols for each participant, and concatenate participants together to allow for group-level analysis.

The aim of Fino2py is to streamline the data analysis process for researchers and clinicians working with Finometer data, enabling them to focus on their research questions rather than the technical details of data processing. By automating the data processing tasks, Fino2py helps to minimize the potential for human error, reduce processing time, and increase the reproducibility of results.

This package was created by Kevin O'Malley to assist research in the Department of Psychology at the University of Limerick. Feedback and collaberation is most welcome and can be sent to kevin.omalley[@]ul.ie.
